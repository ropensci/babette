Description: 'BEAST2' (<http://www.beast2.org>) is a widely used
  Bayesian phylogenetic tool, that uses DNA/RNA/protein data
  and many model priors to create a posterior of jointly estimated 
  phylogenies and parameters.
  'BEAST2' is commonly accompanied by 'BEAUti 2' (<http://www.beast2.org>), 
  'Tracer' <http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/> 
  and DensiTree (<http://www.beast2.org>).
  'babette' provides for an alternative workflow of using 
  all these tools separately. This allows doing complex Bayesian
  phylogenetics easily and reproducibly from R.
