\arguments{
\item{beast2_input_filename}{path of the 'BEAST2'  configuration file.
By default, this file is put in a temporary folder with a random
filename, as the user needs not read it: it is used as input of 'BEAST2'.
Specifying a \code{beast2_input_filename} allows to store that file
in a more permanently stored location.}

\item{beast2_options}{'BEAST2'  options,
as can be created by \link[beastier]{create_beast2_options}}

\item{beast2_output_log_filename}{name of the log file created by 'BEAST2',
containing the parameter estimates in time. By default, this
file is put a temporary folder with a random
filename, as the user needs not read it: its content
is parsed and returned by this function.
Specifying a \code{beast2_output_log_filename} allows to store that file
in a more permanently stored location.}

\item{beast2_output_state_filename}{name of the final state file created
by 'BEAST2', containing the operator acceptances. By default, this
file is put a temporary folder with a random
filename, as the user needs not read it: its content
is parsed and returned by this function.
Specifying a \code{beast2_output_state_filename} allows to store that file
in a more permanently stored location.}

\item{beast2_output_trees_filenames}{name of the one or more trees
files created by 'BEAST2', one per alignment. By default, these
files are put a temporary folder with a random
filename, as the user needs not read it: their content
is parsed and returned by this function.
Specifying \code{beast2_output_trees_filenames} allows to store these
one or more files in a more permanently stored location.}

\item{beast2_path}{name of either a 'BEAST2'  binary file
(usually simply \code{beast})
or a 'BEAST2'  jar file
(usually has a \code{.jar} extension).
Use \code{get_default_beast2_bin_path} to get
the default BEAST binary file's path
Use \code{get_default_beast2_jar_path} to get
the default BEAST jar file's path}

\item{beast2_working_dir}{the folder 'BEAST2'  will work in. This is
an (empty) temporary folder by default. This allows to call
'BEAST2'  in multiple parallel processes, as each process can have
its own working directory}

\item{cleanup}{set to FALSE to keep all temporary files}

\item{clock_model}{one clock model,
see \link[beautier]{create_clock_model}}

\item{clock_models}{one or more clock models,
see \link[beautier]{create_clock_models}}

\item{fasta_filename}{a FASTA filename}

\item{fasta_filenames}{one or more FASTA filename, each with one alignment}

\item{inference_model}{a Bayesian phylogenetic inference model,
as returned by \link[beautier]{create_inference_model}}

\item{mcmc}{the MCMC options,
see \link[beautier]{create_mcmc}}

\item{mrca_prior}{one Most Recent Common Ancestor prior,
as returned by \code{\link[beautier]{create_mrca_prior}}}

\item{mrca_priors}{a list of one or more Most Recent Common Ancestor priors,
as returned by \code{\link[beautier]{create_mrca_prior}}}

\item{overwrite}{will 'BEAST2'  overwrite files? Like 'BEAST2',
this is set to \link{TRUE} by default.
If \link{TRUE}, 'BEAST2'  will overwrite the
\code{beast2_options$output_state_filename} if its present.
If \link{FALSE}, 'BEAST2'  will not overwrite the
\code{beast2_options$output_state_filename} if its present
and \link{babette} will give an error message.
Note that if \code{overwrite} is set to \link{FALSE} when
a \code{tracelog} (see \link[beautier]{create_tracelog}),
\code{screenlog} (see \link[beautier]{create_screenlog})
or \code{treelog} (see \link[beautier]{create_treelog})
file already exists,
'BEAST2'  (and thus \link{babette}) will freeze.}

\item{rng_seed}{the random number generator seed. Must be either
\code{NA} or a positive non-zero value. An RNG seed of \code{NA}
results in 'BEAST2'  picking a random seed.}

\item{site_model}{one site model,
see \link[beautier]{create_site_models}}

\item{site_models}{one or more site models,
see \link[beautier]{create_site_models}}

\item{tipdates_filename}{name of the file containing tip dates}

\item{tree_prior}{one tree priors,
as created by \link[beautier]{create_tree_prior}}

\item{tree_priors}{one or more tree priors,
see \link[beautier]{create_tree_priors}}

\item{verbose}{set to TRUE for more output}

This function does nothing. It is intended to inherit is parameters'
documentation.

\note{
This is an internal function, so it should be marked with
  \code{@noRd}. This is not done, as this will disallow all
  functions to find the documentation parameters
